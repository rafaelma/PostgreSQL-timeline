The intention of this project is to create a diagram with
information about the timeline of the postgreSQL project.

The information this diagram is based on has been obtained via the
PostgreSQL Documentation source code

The version-nodes in the SVG version of the diagram have links to the
changelog information of each version.

Installation
============

We use Graphviz [1] to generate the SVG and PNG versions of the
diagram.

You need to install Graphviz in your system if you want to use the
postgreSQL_timeline.dot file to generate other formats.

You can run these commands to generate the SVG and PNG versions of the
diagram:

dot -Tsvg -o postgreSQL_timeline.svg postgreSQL_timeline.dot 
dot -Tpng -o postgreSQL_timeline.png postgreSQL_timeline.dot
